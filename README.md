# toki Lipa

#### e toki tawa ilo sona

Lipa is a toki pona inspired dialect of the [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language) programming language written in Go.

Currently the program consists of a simple repl that can only evaluate addition, this of course shouldn't stay this way for long as I do plan
to improve on this further.

## Current keywords:
- '+' = sin : add

## Example usage

```
$ go run main.go

|: (+ (+ 1 2) 2)
pona: 5
```
